곳곳에 100㎜에 육박하는 많은 비가 내렸다. 제주의 장마는 평년보다 2~3일, 지난해보다는 하루 일찍 시작됐다. 장마는 고온다습한 북태평양 기단과 한랭 습윤한 오호츠크해 기단이 만나 형성되는 장마전선에서 내리는 비를 뜻한다.장마전선은 18일 제주도 먼 남쪽 해상으로 내려갔다가 20일께 다시 북상해 전남 남해안까지 영향을 줄 것으로 보인다. 이에 따라 20~21일 남부지방에도 예년보다 사흘 정도 장마가 일찍 찾아올 전망이다. 그러나 장마전선을 밀어올리는 북태평양 고기압 세력이 약해 서울 등 중부지방은 평년보다 사나흘가량 늦은 이달 말부터 장마가 시작될 것이라는 게 기상청의 설명이다. 장마전선은 이후 한 달가량 한반도 중남부를 오르내리며 곳곳에 비를 뿌릴 전망이다. 최근 30년간 평균치에 따르면 중부지방의 장마 시작일은 6월24~25일이었으며 장마기간은 32일, 강수일수는 17.2일이었다.기상청은 올해 장마기간의 평균 강수량이 350~400㎜로 평년과 비슷하거나 적을 것으로 내다봤다. 브라질 월드컵 한국과 러시아의 경기가 열리는 18일 오전 서울은 대체로 구름이 많이 끼지만 비는 오지 않을 것으로 예상돼 거리 응원에는 지장이 없을 전망이다.',\n","

지원사업’은 강소SW기업 및 초기 스타트업의 SW서비스 사업화 지원과 신시장 진출 지원을 통해 기업 경쟁력 강화와 지역경제 활성화를 도모하는 사업이다. 올해부터 2개년으로 진행되며, 국비와 시비, 민자 등 2년간 약 37억원의 예산이 투입된다. 앞서 진흥원은 부산의 미래 먹거리산업인 스마트해양, 지능형기계, 지능정보서비스 분야로 사전 수요조사를 진행했고, 평가를 통해 선정된 5개 과제를 공모사업에 신청했다. 그 결과 부산의 4개 과제가 최종 선정되는 쾌거를 거뒀다. 당 사업은 전국 진흥기관을 대상으로 공모를 시작해, 총 17개 지역에서 42개 과제가 선정되었으며, 4개 과제가 선정된 곳은 부산과 강원지역 뿐이다. 금번 선정된 과제들은 ‘인공지능융합센서와 서보 이송 로봇을 이용한 전단보강재의 자동용접시스템 개발’ 등 총 4개 과제다. 부산시가 지원하고, 부산정보산업진흥원과 지역기업, 대학, 연구소 등이 컨소시엄을 구성하여 기술개발 및 사업화 지원을 추진한다. 2개의 Track으로 구분되는 이번사업은 Track 1(SW중소기업)에서 ㈜에이아이플랫폼, 엔컴(주), Track 2(스타트업)에서는 ㈜토즈, 삼보테크놀로지를 지원한다. ○ ‘Track 1‘의 (주)에이아이플랫폼이 주관기업으로 진행하는 <인공지능 기반 망막 내 아밀로이드 플라크 영상 분석을 통한 치매조기진단 플랫폼 상용화>는 치매 확진의 원인이 되는 중요 단백질(아밀로이드 플라크)을 자체개발 관측장비로 진단한다. 이를 통해 치매를 조기 발견하여, 각종 경제적 비용과 치료 및 예방 등 사회적 문제를 해 결하고 시민들이 쉽게 접근 가능한 실효성 있는 치매관리체계 개발을 목표로 한다. ○ 엔컴(주)이 주관기업으로 참여하는 <AI영상분석 기반 가공철근 생산성 향상 시스템 기술개발 및 사업화>는 산업안전, 환경규제, 생산체계의 변화로 침체된 부산 핵심 산업인 철강업 활성화에 나선다. 실시간으로 절곡되어 나오는 가공철근의 형상을 인식하고 불량 형상 판단 시 적합한 교정 값을 절곡설비에 전달함으로써, 무중단 생산이 가능한 영상분석 기술과 생산설비 자동화 제어기술을 개발한다. ○ ‘Track 2’의 ㈜토즈는 자립기반이 약한 국내 중소형 조선소의 산업기술 변화에 혁신적인 대응을 위해 <가상현실 기반 원격 다자간 선박 및 해양구조물 사전 검사 시스템>을 개발한다. 선박 건조 前, 설계 단계에서 설계자 뿐만 아니라 생산관리자, 품질관리자, 선급검사관, 선주감독관 등의 이해관계자가 공동으로 가상의 환경에서 선박 및 해양구조물의 자재 배치와 간섭, 작업성, 설계 오작 등에 대한 검사를 진행할 수 있는 기술을 확보하여 조선소의 업무효율을 극대화 할 예정이다. ○ 삼보테크놀로지는 재래식 건설 부자재의 시공성, 안전성, 내구성 등의 문제점을 보완하여 시민 안전과 건설근로자의 환경개선, 생산성 및 수익성 향상을 위해 <인공지능융합센서와 새들형 토치 서보 이송 로봇을 이용한 고속 SRD 전단보강재 자동용접시스템>을 개발한다. 로봇응용 SRD 용접자동화 설비를 제작하고, 용접 모니터링 및 품질검사 소프트웨어를 개발하여 건설분야에 4차산업 대비 지능형 생산자동화 기반기술을 확보할 예정이다. (재)부산정보산업진흥원 이인숙 원장은 “이번 코로나19 사태로 인해 부산 기업들이 매출과 고용유지, 자재수급 등에 큰 타격을 입었지만, 지역SW서비스사업화 지원사업을 통해 지역과 기업차원에서 기반을 다지는 계기가 됐으면 좋겠다‘며 ”진흥원은 어려운 사태를 대비해 지역 기업들을 지원할 수 있는 다른 방편을 계속 모색 중이며, 더욱 성장해 나갈 수 있도록 적극 지원하겠다“고 전했다.',\n","   'qas': [{'question': '지능형 생산자동화 기반기술을 개발중인 스타트업은?',\n","     'answers': [{'text': '삼보테크놀로지', 'answer_start': 1422}],\n","     'guid': '67c85e4f86ae43939b807684537c909c'}]}],\n","
